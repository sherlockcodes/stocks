Stocks Recommendations:
=======================	

It's been almost one month for me in investment in the stock market. I started loving the way it works. 

Just one tweet by Donald trump or announcement by Narendra modi, whole indian stock market goes down like butter on hot pan.

Likewise, what I witnessed is sudden spike on stocks during quarterly result announcement dates. If company reported profit though ;)

for example, Kotak mahindra bank announced 39% Q3 profit. http://www.moneycontrol.com/news/results/kotak-mahindra-bank-q3-profit-zooms-39-asset-quality-improves_8341841.html. stock value increased to 7% in a day!

from Rs 747 to Rs 801. Just in one day. Lets say If you have invested 100000 rupees, you would have got 8370 rupees as profit. 

there are other examples as well. So what I did is scrapped all companies from moneycontrol.com who going to report quarterly announcements in upcoming days and generated recommendations based on following things.

* open price
* previous day close price
* current price
* total buy quantity
* total sell quantity
* sector information
* preferred stock price range by user.
